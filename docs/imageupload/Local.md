# Local image upload

Local image upload is not an upload at all. The files are instead created in a specified folder on your local machine.

This is useful for local testing as the image upload step is very fast. It can also be used to stage local files to later use the TTS upload to cloud option.

## Usage

Just enter a folder to store the files.
