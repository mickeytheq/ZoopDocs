# Zoop manual

Zoop is a plugin for [Strange Eons](https://cgjennings.ca/eons/). It works with the Arkham LCG plugin for Strange Eons to provide tools to export, import and manage Strange Eons projects.

It provides quality-of-life tools to improve the management of homebrew Arkham LCG projects within Strange Eons.

## Features

The primary features of Zoop are

- [Export to TTS](tts/TtsExport.md) - Export of card images, upload of card images to a cloud host and creation/updates to a TTS saved object for use within the SCED TTS mod for Arkham LCG. Includes creation of the SCED metadata information.
- [Print and Play export](printandplay/PrintAndPlay.md) - Export of card images to a local directory for Print and Play purposes. Provides output compatible with the [MPC chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/mpc-project-helper/oigcfklkajlgkeblpngmbgjniiejabko?hl=en-GB&pli=1)
- [Automatic numbering](automaticnumbering/AutomaticNumbering.md) - Adds collection and encounter numbering to cards.
- [Bulk update](bulkupdate/BulkUpdate.md) - Bulk update a selection of cards on multiple cards. For example updating the Collection or Encounter Set information across a set of cards or an entire project.
- [Export and import](exportimport/ExportImport.md) - Export and import of card details to/from Excel for external editing. Useful for translating to a different language in a more convenient format than within Strange Eons.

Other features include

- [Encounter card unrolling](shared/encountersetunrolling/EncounterSetUnrolling.md) - create multiple copies of a card from a single source card
- [Campaign guide creation](shared/campaignguides/CampaignGuides.md) - creation of campaign guide PDFs
- [Instructions](shared/instructions/Instructions.md) - alter behaviour of Zoop based on user specified rules. For example swapping one face on a card for another
