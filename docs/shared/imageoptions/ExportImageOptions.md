# Export image options

When using a Zoop function that exports the card images, such as the Export to TTS option you will be presented with the following option screen

![ImageOptions](ExportImageOptions.png)

Note that this screen has been copied from the SE bulk export plug-in and the image output should be identical to that produced by a regular Strange Eons export.

Some of the options, Exclude simple back faces, are ignored by Zoop.
