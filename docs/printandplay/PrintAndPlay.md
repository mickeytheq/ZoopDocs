# Print and play

Zoop supports bulk exporting a Strange Eons project to image files in a local directory. Primarily this is for print and play purposes but could be used for other needs where you want a copy of the image files locally.

**Please thoroughly check any output produced by this function. While Zoop will endeavour to produce the correct output based on the specified settings bugs do happen.**

This mode supports multi-select of folders to export a flexible selection of your content in one batch.

Zoop supports the following print and play export modes
-	MPC – This produces files compatible with the MPC plugin for the chrome browser. The chrome plugin supports automated upload of files to the MPC website for printing

## Usage

Right click on a folder in Strange Eons. You will see a right click option under the Zoop menu to **Exports to print and play files**.

| Option | Details |
| ---- | ---- |
| Mode | The options are - MPC – creates files compatible with the chrome browser plugin for creating MPC projects
| Logging Level | Generally, you can leave this on Normal. If you want more details or feedback on the process set it to the other options for more logging. This does not impact the behaviour or output in any way |
| Player card back | Specify a local file to use as the player card back in the output. Zoop includes a default image but you may wish to use a different one. |
| Encounter card back	| Specify a local file to use as the encounter card back in the output. Zoop includes a default image but you may wish to use a different one. |
| Temporary export folder | A folder where Strange Eons can export the files. This is a staging area so a temporary folder such as C:\Temp or equivalent is suitable. |
| Output folder for printable files | A folder where you want the final output files placed. |

After clicking OK you will see a second set of options for selecting image quality. These are reasonably self-explanatory.

Here is a screenshot of options. This shows options suitable for TTS however for Print and Play you may wish to increase the quality.
